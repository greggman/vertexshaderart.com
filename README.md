# vertexshaderart.com is in transition to a static site

Soundcloud changed their API and I can't be bothered to fix this code.
Tools are out of date etc and it's just too much work for a site that
gets almost no traffic and that I, myself, rarely use.

Using Soundcloud has always been problematic. They've changed their API
more than once causing a bunch of work. Artists delete their accounts, or
delete songs, or change permissions
and then the visualizations here are left non-working.

So, I took the server offline. It ran for ~9 years.

I'm working on putting up the data. Unfortunately, without soundcloud,
most of the visualizations will do nothing. I will look into putting in
some random music and/or provide options to use other sources of music.

I will also probably try to make new stuff url based so it's entirely a
static website.
