# vertexshaderart.com is offline

Soundcloud changed their API and I can't be bothered to fix this code.
Tools are out of date etc and it's just too much work for a site that
gets almost no traffic and that I, myself, rarely use.

Using Soundcloud has always been problematic. They've changed their API
more than once causing a bunch of work. Artists delete their accounts, or
delete songs, or change permissions
and then the visualizations here are left non-working.

I thought about maybe trying to find a few 1000s free tracks
and upload them somewhere streamable but that would also be
too much work.

So, I took the site offline.

It ran for ~9 years.
